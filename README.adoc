== Project

I use this project to build my resume in 2 languages: French and English.

This also generates 2 different formats: html and pdf. +
I am using asciidoctor to generate both documents.

=== HTML themes

I inspired my current theme from here:

https://github.com/darshandsoni/asciidoctor-skins

=== PDF themes

I tweaked the default theme.

== Gitlab Deployment

As you can see into the gitlab-ci.yml file, I am building 2 different docker images, one for each language. +
Both images are built on top of an nginx.

For the runtime of those applications, I am using those 2 projects:

- https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy
- https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion
