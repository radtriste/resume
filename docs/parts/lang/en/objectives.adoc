Currently working as an Infrastructure and Software Architect, I am looking for a new challenge into an international context, which provide architectural challenges and is offering remote working. 
The challenge could be the modernization of old systems or the creation of a whole application from scratch. 
Nice to have would be to work with Cloud systems.
